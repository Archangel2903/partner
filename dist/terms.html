                        you to provide any documentation to verify the Affiliate Application, or the Affiliate Account information at any time during the term of the Affiliate
                        Agreement. You must provide information that is correct and that such information is kept up-to-date at all times.</p>

                        participate in our Affiliate Program. Administrative fee сonstitutes up to 35%.</p>
